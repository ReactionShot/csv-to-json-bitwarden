# csv-to-json-bitwarden
The goal of this project is to make it so you can easily export your google contacts or any contacts into Bitwarden. This project uses Python to convert a CSV file into JSON, which can then be easily imported into Bitwarden. The reason we're converting the CSV file to JSON is because Bitwarden only accepts JSON for Identity entries.
