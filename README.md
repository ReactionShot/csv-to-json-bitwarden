# csv-to-json-bitwarden
The goal of this project is to make it so you can easily export your Google contacts or any contacts into Bitwarden. This project uses Python to convert a CSV file into JSON, which can then be easily imported into Bitwarden. The reason we're converting the CSV file to JSON is because Bitwarden only accepts JSON for Identity entries.

At the moment, you still need to add the parent of items, but I'm working on getting that fixed programmatically.
